----------------- COVID VACCINATIONS -------------------

```sql
----- Percentage of fully vaccinated, people vaccinated and percentages of that
WITH PopvsVac (Continent, Location,Date, Population, New_Vaccinations, Total_People_Vaccinated, Total_People_Fully_Vaccinated)
AS
(
	SELECT Dea.continent, Dea.location, Dea.date, Dea.population, 
	   Vac.new_vaccinations,

	   SUM(CONVERT(INT, vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location 
	   ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS Percentage_Population_At_Lease_1_Jab, --SUM of New Vaccines Given

	   SUM(CONVERT(BIGINT, vac.people_fully_vaccinated)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location 
	   ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS Total_People_Fully_Vaccinated
	   
	FROM master..covid_deaths Dea

	JOIN master..covid_vaccinations Vac
	ON Dea.location = Vac.location
	AND Dea.date = Vac.date

	WHERE Dea.continent IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT *, (Total_People_Vaccinated/Population)*100 AS Percentage_Population_At_Lease_1_Jab, (Total_People_Fully_Vaccinated/Population)*100 as Population_Fully_Vaccinated FROM PopvsVac 
ORDER BY 2,3
```

After that, I went ahead and queried the percentage of population fully vaccinated per country day by day

```sql
--Percentage Population Fully Vaccinated
SELECT location, date, population, CAST(people_fully_vaccinated AS INT) AS Population_Fully_Vaccinated,

((CAST(people_fully_vaccinated AS INT))/population)*100 AS Percentage_People_Fully_Vaccinated

FROM master..covid_vaccinations_with_pop
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2
```

And also queried the total of population fully vaccinated by country


---- SUM of People Fully Vaccinated

SELECT location, 

MAX(CAST(people_fully_vaccinated AS BIGINT)) AS People_Fully_Vaccinated

FROM master..covid_vaccinations
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

After that, I calculated the percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated against Covid-19 per country


--- Percentage of Population FULLY Vaccinated per Contry

SELECT location,

MAX(population) AS Population,
MAX(CAST(people_fully_vaccinated AS BIGINT))							AS Fully_Vaccinated,
(MAX(CAST(people_fully_vaccinated AS BIGINT))/MAX(population))*100		AS Percentage_Fully_Vaccinated
FROM master..covid_vaccinations_with_pop

WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY 4 DESC
```

And in order to know which is the population partly and fully vaccinated, I had to know which percentage of the population had one jab, and which percentage of the population was already fully vaccinated per contry.

```sql
--Percemtage of people with one jab, and fully vaccinated

SELECT location,

MAX(population) AS Population,
MAX(CAST(people_vaccinated AS BIGINT))								AS Vaccines_Applied,
MAX(CAST(people_fully_vaccinated AS BIGINT))					AS People_Fully_Vaccinated,

((MAX(CAST(people_vaccinated AS BIGINT)))-(MAX(CAST(people_fully_vaccinated AS BIGINT))))		AS People_Firtst_Jab,
(((MAX(CAST(people_vaccinated AS BIGINT)))-(MAX(CAST(people_fully_vaccinated AS BIGINT)))) / MAX(population))*100 AS Percentage_Population_Partially_immunized,

(MAX(CAST(people_fully_vaccinated AS BIGINT))/MAX(population))*100		AS Percentage_Fully_Vaccinated

FROM master..covid_vaccinations_with_pop
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY 7 DESC
```

To finish the data analysis on this Dataset, I queried which was the percentage of the population fully vaccinated per country, as shown on the query below.

```sql
SELECT location,
MAX(population) AS Population,
MAX(CAST(people_fully_vaccinated AS BIGINT))													AS People_Fully_Vaccinated,
(MAX(CAST(people_fully_vaccinated AS BIGINT))/MAX(population))*100		AS Percentage_Fully_Vaccinated
FROM master..covid_vaccinations_with_pop
WHERE continent is null 
AND location NOT IN ('European Union', 'International')
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY 1
